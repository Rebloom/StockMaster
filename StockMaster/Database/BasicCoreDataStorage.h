 * Convenience method to get a managedObjectContext appropriate for use on the main thread.

 * NSManagedObjectContext is a light-weight thread-UNsafe component of the CoreData stack.
 * Thus a managedObjectContext should only be accessed from a single thread, or from a serialized queue.
 *
 * A managedObjectContext is associated with a persistent store.
 * In most cases the persistent store is an sqlite database file.
 * So think of a managedObjectContext as a thread-specific cache for the underlying database.
 *
 * This method lazily creates a proper managedObjectContext,
 * associated with the persistent store of this instance,
 * and configured to automatically merge changesets from other threads.
